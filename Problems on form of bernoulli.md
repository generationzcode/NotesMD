>During a trip to the beach. $P_{atm}$ = 1atm, a car runs out of gas,It becomes necessary to siphon gas out of the tank of a good samaritan. The siphon is a small diameter hose and to start the siphon it becomes necessary to insert one end in the full gasoline tank, fill the hose with gasoline via suction and then place the other end in the gasoline can below the level of the gasoline tank. The difference in pressure between point 1 and point 2 causes the liquid to flow from higher to lower elevation. Point 2 is located 0.75 meter below point 1. Point 3 is located 2m above point 1. So the liquid flows from point 1 to 3 finally to 2. Frictional losses are to be disregarded. Diameter of hose is 4mm.

## Solution

Bernoulli equation in *head* form
$$\frac{P_1}{\rho g} + \frac{v_1^2}{2g}+h_1+pump = \frac{P_2}{\rho g} + \frac{v_2^2}{2g}+h_2+fric$$
Take the tank as point 0, the pressure at 0 and 2 are the same, thus:
$$\frac{P_0}{\rho g} + \frac{v_0^2}{2g}+h_0= \frac{P_2}{\rho g} + \frac{v_2^2}{2g}+h_2$$
=>$$h_0= \frac{v_2^2}{2g}+h_2$$
since v_0 is approximately 0m/s
> the rest of part 1 is really easy


the *pump* and *fric* terms are 0, $P_2 = 1atm$, $h_1-h_2 = 0.75$, $v_1=v_2$:
$$\frac{P_1}{750*9.81}= {\frac{101325}{750*9.81}-0.75}$$
=> $$P_1 = 95806pa$$
Thus pressure at point 3 is:
=> $$\frac{P_1}{\rho g}+h_1-h_3 = \frac{P_3}{\rho g}$$=> $$\frac{95806}{750*9.81}-2 = \frac{P_3}{750*9.81}$$
=> $$P_3 = 81091pa$$
